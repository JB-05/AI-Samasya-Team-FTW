# Example Safe Reports

These reports serve as precedent anchors for acceptable language and structure.

## Example 1: Pattern Observation

The learner showed varying response patterns during recent activities. This variation is a common observation that many learners demonstrate as they engage with different tasks. The patterns suggest ongoing development in focus and attention skills.

Supportive approaches that may help include providing structured routines and allowing for natural breaks during activities. These approaches can help maintain engagement while respecting the learner's natural rhythm.

## Example 2: Steady Engagement

Across multiple activities, the learner demonstrated consistent engagement and participation. Responses appeared steady and focused, which suggests the learner is developing comfort with structured learning tasks.

This pattern indicates that the current approach is supporting the learner's natural learning style. Continuing with similar activities may help maintain this positive engagement.

## Example 3: Building Skills

The learner showed developing skills in tracking and responding to visual targets. Some responses were successful, while others showed the learner is still building these abilities. This is expected during skill development.

Activities that allow for practice at a comfortable pace may support continued growth. Celebrating successful responses can help build confidence as the learner continues to develop these skills.
